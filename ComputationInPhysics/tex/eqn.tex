The particular function whose integral the Difference Engine was constructed to
tabulate, is $\Delta^7u_x=0$. The purpose which that engine has been specially
intended and adapted to fulfil, is the computation of nautical and astronomical
tables. The integral of $\Delta^7u_x=0$ being   $u_z =
a+bx+cx^2+dx^3+ex^4+fx^5+gx^6$, the constants a, b, c, etc. are represented on the
seven columns of discs, of which the engine consists.

\pagebreak
The following is a more complicated example of the manner in which the
engine would compute a trigonometrical function containing variables.
To multiply

\begin{equation}
F(x, y, z, \log x, \sin y, x^p)
\end{equation}

which is, it will be observed, a function of all other functions of any number 
of quantities.
