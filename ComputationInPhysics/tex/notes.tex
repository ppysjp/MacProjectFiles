The particular function whose integral the Difference Engine was constructed to
tabulate, is $\Delta^7u_x=0$. The purpose which that engine has been specially
intended and adapted to fulfil, is the computation of nautical and astronomical
tables. The integral of $\Delta^7u_x=0$ being   $u_z =
a+bx+cx^2+dx^3+ex^4+fx^5+gx^6$, the constants a, b, c, etc. are represented on the
seven columns of discs, of which the engine consists.

The following is a more complicated example of the manner in which the
engine would compute a trigonometrical function containing variables.
To multiply

\begin{align}
&A+A_1 \cos \theta + A_2\cos 2\theta + A_3\cos 3\theta + \cdots
\intertext{by}
&B + B_1 \cos \theta.
\end{align}
